# Moltar

It's good.

## Installation

It's distributed in the MxM Homebrew repository. So add it:

```
brew tap madebymany/custom
```

Then install:

```
brew install madebymany/custom/moltar
```

Yay!

## Distribution

If you've made a new version you want to distribute, run the `dist` script. You'll need an `~/.aws/config` with an `MxM` profile that has credentials for the Made by Many account. The script will output lines you'll need to update the moltar homebrew recipe in.
